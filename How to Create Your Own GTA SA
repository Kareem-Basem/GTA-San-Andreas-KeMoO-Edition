üéÆ How to Create Your Own GTA: San Andreas Mods
Welcome to the GTA: San Andreas Modding Guide! This guide is based on my experience creating the KeMoO Edition (V. 5), where I enhanced graphics, vehicles, weapons, audio, and gameplay with tools like CLEO and custom scripts. Here, I‚Äôll walk you through the steps to create your own mods, even if you‚Äôre a beginner.
Why Mod GTA: San Andreas?
Modding lets you personalize San Andreas, from improving visuals to adding new vehicles or enhancing gameplay with scripts. It‚Äôs a great way to refresh a classic 1990s game while learning new skills!
Step 1: Prepare Your Tools üõ†Ô∏è
You‚Äôll need the following tools to start modding:

IMG Tool: A simple tool for editing .img files in San Andreas (e.g., gta3.img for vehicles and models). Download from GTA modding sites like GTAInside.
TXD Workshop: For editing textures (.txd files). Search on GTA modding forums like GTAForums.
Photoshop or GIMP: For creating or editing textures. GIMP is free (download from gimp.org).
WinRAR: For extracting and managing mod files. Download from win-rar.com.
CLEO Mod: For adding custom scripts (e.g., free camera). Download from cleo.li.
Modloader: For easy mod management. Available on GTA modding sites.

Setup Tips

Backup Your Game: Before modding, copy your GTA: San Andreas game folder to a safe location.
Run as Administrator: Run IMG Tool, CLEO, and other tools as Administrator to avoid permission issues.

Step 2: Modifying Textures (Graphics) üñºÔ∏è
Textures control how everything looks‚Äîcharacters, buildings, vehicles, etc. Let‚Äôs start with changing CJ‚Äôs outfit.
Example: Change CJ‚Äôs Shirt

Locate the Texture File:
Open IMG Tool and navigate to your GTA: San Andreas folder.
Go to models/ and open gta3.img.
Find player.txd (contains CJ‚Äôs textures) and extract it to your desktop (Commands > Extract).


Edit the Texture:
Open player.txd in TXD Workshop.
Look for a texture like player_torso (CJ‚Äôs shirt).
Export it as a .bmp or .png file.
Open in Photoshop/GIMP, edit (e.g., change to a green shirt), and save as .bmp or .png.


Import the New Texture:
In TXD Workshop, import the edited texture to replace player_torso.
Save the file.
In IMG Tool, delete the old player.txd (Commands > Delete) and add the modified one (Commands > Add).


Test In-Game:
Launch GTA: San Andreas and check if CJ‚Äôs shirt updated. If not, ensure files are saved correctly and run as Administrator.



Pro Tip
For better lighting (like Los Santos in KeMoO Edition), adjust brightness and contrast in Photoshop/GIMP. Increase brightness for neon effects or shadows for a 1990s night vibe.
Step 3: Replacing Vehicles üöó
Vehicles refresh San Andreas‚Äôs 1990s feel. Let‚Äôs replace a car.
Example: Replace the Sultan with a Custom 1990s Car

Find a Vehicle Model:
Search for free San Andreas-compatible models on GTA5-Mods or GTAInside.
Download a 1990s-style car (e.g., a Dodge Viper), including .dff (model) and .txd (texture).


Replace the Vehicle:
Open IMG Tool and go to models/gta3.img.
Find sultan.dff and sultan.txd, extract as backup (Commands > Extract).
Delete the old files (Commands > Delete).
Add the new .dff and .txd files (Commands > Add).
Save changes (Commands > Rebuild Archive).


Test In-Game:
Launch the game and find a Sultan (spawns in Los Santos).
Check if the new model works. Fix missing textures by ensuring .txd matches .dff.



Pro Tip
Match the 1990s vibe (like in KeMoO Edition) with retro cars and vibrant colors. Test handling for smooth driving.
Step 4: Basic Audio Modding üîä
Audio mods enhance the atmosphere. Let‚Äôs replace a radio song.
Example: Add a New Song to Radio Los Santos

Locate the Audio Files:
Navigate to audio/ in your GTA: San Andreas folder.
Find the RADIOLS folder (Radio Los Santos).
Copy an .mp3 file (e.g., radiols_01.mp3) as backup.


Prepare Your Song:
Find a 1990s song (e.g., "California Love" by 2Pac).
Convert to .mp3 using GTA Audio Editor (search online).


Replace the Song:
Replace radiols_01.mp3 in the RADIOLS folder with your new file.


Test In-Game:
Start the game, get in a car, and switch to Radio Los Santos.
Check if the new song plays. Ensure correct format if it fails.



Pro Tip
Choose 1990s hip-hop or funk (like KeMoO Edition) for immersion. Adjust environmental sounds (e.g., city noise in Los Santos) for realism.
Step 5: Using CLEO Mods (Advanced) üéÆ
CLEO Mods add custom scripts. Based on KeMoO Edition, here‚Äôs how:
Example: Add a Free Camera

Install CLEO:
Download CLEO for San Andreas from cleo.li and place the CLEO folder in your game directory.


Add a Script:
Copy a script like FreeCam.cs (from modding forums) into the CLEO folder.


Test In-Game:
Launch the game and press the assigned key (check the script‚Äôs readme) to activate the free camera.



Pro Tip

Use 60cframelimiter.cs for smoother frame rates.
Test scripts individually to avoid conflicts.
Enhance visuals with .asi scripts (e.g., ParticleEx.asi for better effects).

Step 6: Test and Optimize ‚öôÔ∏è
Test your mods carefully:

Test After Each Change: Launch after every mod to catch issues.
Update Graphics Drivers: Keep GPU drivers updated for 4K support.
Check Compatibility: Test mod combinations to avoid conflicts.
Use the "tricks" Folder: Check for extra tweaks if available.
